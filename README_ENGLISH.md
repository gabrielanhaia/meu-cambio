# Meu CÃ¢mbio

Notes on updating the feed: A database structure has been created that can be viewed in the `database` (image) folder. This structure saves all the publications (every hour of the last execution), however, I saved it as a manual task (Item 7) using the laravel command.

## Login and how to use the API:

In addition to this documentation, you can import my postman collection with the [https://www.getpostman.com/collections/0f3de4c8c196ddfd5747](https://www.getpostman.com/collections/0f3de4c8c196ddfd5747] link,
or you can just import using Swagger 2.0 (`api_v1.yml`) using your favorite http client.
